I used the monthly user dataframe from the Sprint 3 project.  Visitors to the app are offered a choice to view the whole dataframe or just the piece I use for this application.

The scatter plot shows the revenue each individual produced by Month and Plan

The histogram shows the number of individuals(months) who spent each amount and which plan they used.

Feel free to click the plan buttons (and of course the st.checkbutton!) to remove either plan's data from the graphs.
